        <p>I get confused a lot when it comes to tech and I am trying to fix that.</p>
        <p>"Hey, I'm Jason Nguyen, or Duy Bao Nguyen if you want to go full legal. I'm breaking ground as the first in
          my fam to tackle college life. Grabbed an associate degree in business at South Seattle College, and now I'm
          gunning for a Software Development Bachelor's at Bellevue College. Always been the curious type, poking around
          and figuring out stuff that catches my eye. Cars and tech are my sweet spots â€“ whether I'm under the hood or
          diving into some code. Sure, I'm a bit green in the tech scene, but we all start somewhere, right? It's all
          about the journey, and I'm pumped for what's coming my way!"</p>
